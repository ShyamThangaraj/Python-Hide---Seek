## Introduction

Welcome to the Turtle Hide and Seek Game! This Python-based game utilizes the turtle module to create an interactive hide and seek experience. The game allows players to explore different maps, such as the Park, Living Room, and Garage, where a turtle hides in various positions, and the player must guess the correct location.

## Features

### Maps
1. **Park:**
   - The Basketball court
   - The Swings
   - The carousel
   - The bench
   - The seesaw
   - The park sign
   - The skateboard

2. **Living Room:**
   - The TV
   - The couch
   - The Dining table
   - The refrigerator
   - The tree
   - The desk
   - The oven

3. **Garage:**
   - The pingpong table
   - Christmas tree
   - The workbench
   - The TV
   - The Arcade
   - The car
   - The lawn mower
   - The cabinet
   - The lamp

### Levels
- **Easy:** 5 tries to guess the hiding spot.
- **Hard:** 3 tries to guess the hiding spot.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. Choose a map (Park, Living Room, or Garage) by entering the respective name.
3. Select the difficulty level (easy or hard).
4. Follow the instructions to guess the hiding spot within the given tries.

## Coding Methods and Algorithms

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The game is structured using OOP principles, with turtle objects representing characters and map elements.

- **Random Positioning:** The turtle's hiding position is randomly chosen from a list of possible locations within each map.

- **User Input Handling:** The game utilizes input() to receive user guesses and validates them against the correct hiding position.

- **Algorithmic Logic:** The game implements logic to determine if the user's guess is correct and handles different levels of difficulty.

## Map Selection
- Enter 'Park' to play in the Park.
- Enter 'Living Room' to play in the Living Room.
- Enter 'Garage' to play in the Garage.
- Enter 'End' to exit the game.

## Level Selection
- Enter 'easy' for an easier game with more tries.
- Enter 'hard' for a challenging game with fewer tries.
